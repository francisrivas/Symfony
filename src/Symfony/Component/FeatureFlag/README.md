FeatureFlag Component
======================

The FeatureFlag component provides a service that checks if a feature is
enabled. A feature is a callable which returns a value compared to the
expected one to determine is the feature is enabled (mostly a boolean but not
limited to).

**This Component is experimental**.
[Experimental features](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/experimental.html)
are not covered by Symfony's
[Backward Compatibility Promise](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html).
